# BH WP Dev

Some scripts and notes for WordPress development. Hopefully these will get turned into Composer scripts and GitHub Actions eventually.


```
  "scripts": {
        "create-plugin-archive": [
            "BrianHenryIE\\WP_Dev\\CreatePluginArchive::createZip"
        ]
    }
```
`composer run-script create-plugin-archive`
